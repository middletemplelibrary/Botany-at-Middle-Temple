## Introduction

Plants provide the foundation for nearly all life on earth. The chloroplasts in green plants provide some 70% of our breathable oxygen and sit at the centre of countless ecosystems. By the same token, plants are essential to human life and civilization. Grains, pulses, fruits, and vegetables are staple foods around the world, and the calories from a single species of rice – Oryza sativa – sustain over 3.5 billion people. Plant fibres provide us with clothing, plant timbers provide us with building materials for shelter, and plant-derived compounds still provide the active ingredients in many of our most effective medicines.
Plants also provide the materials for some poisons, which have been used for centuries to commit heinous crimes. Ricin, for example, which is derived from castor beans, was used to poison the Bulgarian defector Georgi Markov in London in 1978. Even nicotine, found in nightshade plants (Solanaceae), can be a deadly neurotoxin when used in large quantities.\
The Library’s Rare Book and Manuscript collections provide a wealth of materials to explore the fascinating topic of botany and plants – from sixteenth-century woodcuts illustrating medical botany, seventeenth-century tracts promoting food security, to murder trials. The Archive has a rich repository of documents that also tell the story of botany at the Inn, such as gardener’s bills and photographs. And, of course, the Inn has a beautiful garden with a rich and interesting past and present. 
This exhibition links materials from the Inn’s Archives, Rare Books, and Manuscript collections, combined with materials from the garden, to explore the splendid and diverse role that plants and botany play at the Inn. It was curated by Will Beharrell, Librarian at the Linnean Society, and Kate Jenrick and Renae Satterley, respectively Gardener and Librarian at Middle Temple, with the generous support of Victoria Hildreth, Assistant Archivist; Liane Owen, Book Conservator; and Siobhán Prendergast, Conservator.

## Joachim Camerarius, De re rustica opuscula nonnulla, 1577

Like many early-modern botanists, Joachim Camerarius the Younger (1534-1598) was chiefly employed as a physician, pursuing a private medical practice in Nuremberg where he later became Dean of the College of Medicine. Botany remained an engaging side-hustle, and this imposing bibliography attempts a classification of the state of knowledge on agricultural matters up to Camerarius’ lifetime. Intriguingly, it lists many works by classical authorities now known to be lost, demonstrating a reverence for the knowledge of antiquity that continued well into the enlightenment.

## Joannes de Laet, Novus orbis seu descriptionis Indiae Occidentalis libri XVIII, 1633

Just three crops – sugar, tobacco, and cotton – provided much of the economic impetus for European colonial expansion in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Sugar alone represented nearly 20% of European imports by value by the end of the eighteenth-century, with the annual trade thought to be worth nearly £7m by 1788. Much of that wealth originated in the West Indies, powered by a brutal triangular trade in enslaved people.
The growing importance of this trade can be measured indirectly by the gradual mapping of the territories in which it took place. This 1633 atlas of North America, by the leading cartographer Johannes de Laet (1581-1649), was ground-breaking in its day. It contains the first appearance in print of many now famous place names, including ‘Massachusetts’ and ‘Manhattan’, and many woodcut illustrations, such as this one depicting cocoa beans.

## Ole Worm, Museum Wormianum, 1655

With the increasing respectability of the natural sciences came a new kind of gentlemanly pursuit: the creation of spectacular Wunderkammer, or ‘cabinets of curiosity’, in which an unhinged medley of natural history paraphernalia could be presented for the improvement of scholarship and the glorification of its owner. 
Perhaps the most famous of the early-modern cabinet ‘curators’ was Ole Worm (1588-1654), a Danish physician and antiquary and Professor at the University of Copenhagen. His ‘Museum Wormianum’ contained hundreds of specimens, taxidermy, and fossils. This 1655 catalogue was prepared from Worm’s notes and published after his death. It was purchased by the Inn in 1658 using a £50 donation made by Sir Richard Pepys (1588-1659), uncle to Samuel Pepys, to buy books for the new Library. It is open to show a woodcut illustration of ‘Zubucaio’, Lecythis zabucaja, a tree indigenous to the rainforests of the Guianas, East Venezuela, and Central and West Amazonia.

## Pietro de’ Crescenzi, Opera di agricoltura, 1553

Pietro de’ Crescenzi (c.1230-1320) was another natural historian with a day job. Born in Bologna, he worked as a lawyer and jurist for 30 years, travelling all over Italy. However, he is best remembered today for his works on agriculture and horticulture; his Ruralia commoda (written c.1310) would occupy his retirement years and became the first printed book on agriculture when it was first published in print, in 1471. This reworked edition of 1553 covers a compendium of country pursuits including animal husbandry, hunting, and trapping, with eye-catching diversions into astronomy and winemaking.

## Plant medicine
‘Plant medicine’ is a rather denigrated term these days – with modern pharmacology having mostly abandoned plant-derived compounds in favour of synthetic alternatives – but for centuries plants provided the most effective remedies against a range of human ailments. Many of today’s most common drugs still have a plant-ancestor in their past – from aspirin (willow tree) to opium (poppies), quinine (cinchona) and digoxin (foxgloves) – treating everything from malarial fever to heart disease, and chronic pain.\
The Egyptians provide among the oldest recorded herbals* in the ancient world, but for centuries the most influential text in western medicine was the work of Dioscorides. His ‘De materia medica’ (composed sometime between 50 and 70 CE) was unfathomably influential and remained the basis of most scholarly pharmacopoeias for over 1,600 years.\
All the books in this case originate from the pre-enlightenment milieu in which Dioscoridean materia medica ruled and includes perhaps the most influential renaissance edition (by Pietro Mattioli). It was not until the early nineteenth-century, and the triumph of the scientific deductive method, that Dioscorides was finally knocked off his perch.\
*Books that describe herbs, and their culinary, and medicinal properties.

## Pietro Mattioli, Commentarii secundo aucti, in libros sex Pedacii Dioscoridis Anazarbei de medica materia, 1560 

If Dioscorides’ De materia medica was the most influential medical text of antiquity, then the Italian translation and commentary by Pietro Mattioli (1501-c.1577) was its most influential edition in the renaissance. Originally published with the modest aim of allowing physicians and apothecaries to identify the plants described by Dioscorides – aided by handsome woodcut illustrations – a translation into Latin in 1554, followed by successive additions, emendations, and corrections, saw it transformed into a vade mecum for any respectable physician. It remained in print for nearly 300 years. The book is open to display the woodcut illustration of ‘Malum punicum’, that is, Pomegranate.

## Conrad Gessner, De raris et admirandis herbis, 1555

Conrad Gessner (1516-1565) was probably the most influential naturalist before Linnaeus and is frequently referred to as the father of natural history. He is best remembered today for his monumental Historia Animalium of 1554, but he also wrote several diverting botanical asides. This 1555 work describes the luminescent plants of the mountains, and their medicinal qualities. It is often considered an early work of alpinism. The woodcut illustration is of the plant Drosera rotundifolia, or sundew.

## Nicolás Monardes, Simplicium medicamentorum, 1582 

Mondardes (1493-1588) was a Spanish physician who published prolifically on medical matters throughout his long life. He was known for treatises that drew on Arabic learning, and the pharmaceutical possibilities of newly discovered cash-crops in the Americas. He was an enthusiastic proponent of tobacco as a remedy-of-all-ills, including–somewhat unfortunately – cancer and lung disease. This book, Simplicium medicamentorum, is perhaps his most influential work, and was printed at Antwerp’s famous Plantin press. It was commonly issued with another work, Garcia da Orta’s Aromatum et simplicum aliquot medicamentorum (1574): an important work on medicinal plants. It is open to show that work’s illustration of a galangal plant.

## Prospero Alpini, De plantis Aegypti liber, 1592

Alpini’s ground-breaking study of the Egyptian flora – the first of its kind in Europe – illustrates the problems of marrying new discoveries to the received wisdom of the classical authorities in the early-modern period. Alpini’s attempt to match new species to those described in antiquity was destined for failure, but his precise descriptions – based on specimens he had personally examined – nonetheless provided a useful corrective to the rumours and fables associated with exotic ‘oriental’ plants. His treatise includes the first appearance in print of several now-famous species, including the banana, baobab, and Arabic coffee plants. The woodcut illustration is of the tamarind tree, Tamarindus indica.\

Allison Fulton, Amara Santiesteban Serrano, and Jeannette Schollaert have written about tamarind at the Plant Humanities Lab site.\

## Plants in the legal world

Plants are well represented in the legal world. Legal cases include those on plant theft, the illegal importation of protected species, murder trials involving the use of poisonous plants, ‘sting’ operations on cannabis growers, and the protection of patented genes in plants. There is also a variety of legislation regulating plants and seeds, including the Plant Varieties Act 1997. Additionally, there is a Plant Varieties & Seeds Tribunal that “makes decisions about national listing of new varieties of plants, UK plant variety rights and certain forestry matters”. The Tribunal has been dormant since 1984 as there have been other regulations and methods to resolve the relevant disputes, however.\ 
Certain plant species must be registered on the Great Britain and Northern Ireland Variety Lists. The Controller of Plant Variety Rights keeps a “register of the names of plant varieties in respect of which plant breeders' rights have been granted … and keeps records of plant varieties for which applications for grants of rights are under consideration and for which rights have been granted”.\
Forensic botany, or plant forensics, is a branch of botany that analyses plants and fungi in criminal investigations. Such analysis helps investigators link plant evidence with a crime, “such as placing a suspect at a crime scene through analysis of pollen or seed particles found on their clothing” (Katie Avis-Riordan, Kew Gardens). Plant forensics can also be used to help save someone who has been poisoned, by identifying which plant/toxin has been used, and thus also identifying a potential antidote.\

\
There is a variety of case law involving plants and botany, including:\ 
\
R v Singh, [2010] EWCA Crim 2951: the offender had poisoned her victims (one of whom died) using Indian aconite (Aconitum ferox) in a curry.\
\
US v Norris, 452 F.3d1275: George Norris conspired to import protected orchids from Peru into the United States, in violation of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.\
\
R v. Jones (James), [2010] EWCA Crim 925 : An undercover police officer posed as a buyer in Jones’ hydroponics shop, asking for advice on growing cannabis. Jones explained that it was illegal to grow cannabis, and instead gave the police officer advice on growing ‘tomatoes’. In the appeal, Jones claimed the officer had pressed him to commit an offence – he was originally found guilty of an incitement to produce cannabis, not tomatoes.\
\
Monsanto Technology LLC v Cargill International SA, [2008] F.S.R. 7: “A patent concerning the use of enzymes, which if used in plants conferred resistance to glyphosate herbicide, was valid and had not been infringed by the importation of soya beans grown from seeds carrying the gene for one of the enzymes disclosed in the patent”.\
\
Taylor v Glasgow City Council, [1920] 2 SLT 74: A young boy died from eating the berries of an unspecified poisonous shrub growing in public gardens in Glasgow. His father sued the Corporation of the City of Glasgow as the proprietors and custodians of the gardens for damages for the death of his son. The Court dismissed the action as irrelevant; the father appealed.

Arthur Griffiths, Mysteries of police and crime, 1902
Arthur Griffiths (1838-1908) was the inspector of prisons before becoming a prolific author, and “a significant analyst of the history of crime and prison discipline”. This plate shows various poisonous plants that were often used to murder people, including hemlock (Conium maculatum), foxglove (Digitalis), oleander (Nerium oleander), monkshood (Aconitum), deadly nightshade (Atropa belladonna), strychnine (Strychnos), Christmas rose (Helleborus niger), thorn apple (Datura), and opium (Papaver somniferum). 
Accompanying this book are dried specimens from the gardens at Middle Temple: oleander and thorn apple.
